# Password-Generator-Bootcamp
Hi there,
This project wasn't easy for me, even though I'm happy with the result, it took me a long time to understand if/which variable should be global or not. In this project I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

#ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA#

GIVEN I need a new, secure password WHEN I click the button to generate a password THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria WHEN prompted for password criteria THEN I select which criteria to include in the password WHEN prompted for the length of the password THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters WHEN I answer each prompt THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected WHEN all prompts are answered THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria WHEN the password is generated THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
