# Password-Generator-Bootcamp
Hi there,
This project wasn't easy for me, even though I'm happy with the result, it took me a long time to understand if/which variable should be global or not. In this project I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

#ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA#

GIVEN I need a new, secure password WHEN I click the button to generate a password 

THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria WHEN prompted for password criteria 

THEN I select which criteria to include in the password 

WHEN prompted for the length of the password 

THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters 

WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password 

THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters WHEN I answer each prompt 

THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected WHEN all prompts are answered 

THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria 

WHEN the password is generated 

THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
